```

The following are some suggested notes and descriptions to cover while presenting this workshop. It is not a full script by choice. 

## Initial opening 

This workshop is for students who already have some experience with tidy workflows in R, who are familiar with tidyverse packages like dplyr and tidyr and hope to upgrade their data wrangling skills. 

## Setup 

Please make sure that you have installed all the packages that are listed in the workshop materials. We will make use of all of them. At various times throughout the workshop, I may highlight where some specific functions or datasets come from. 

It is extremely important that your dplyr installation is at least version 1.0. If the current installed version is less than 1.0, make sure to update your package. You may need to restart R to fully install. 

## Tidy Data 

As you may have noticed, the primary package that we loaded is `tidyverse`. The tidyverse is a collection of packages that play nicely with one another. A key component in these packages is that they work best with "tidy" data. 

Tidy data are [refer to definition on main slides] 

Tidy data is composed of three parts. First, each column is a separate variable. Second, each observation is a row. Third, each value is in a separate cell. 

Tidy data is useful for a large class of problems, and is a common default when performing data wrangling and analysis projects. That does not mean that tidy data is the only way to do analysis [refer to Leek quote]. 

Here is an example of what tidy data looks like. When I use a dataset in this workshop that is named table + a number or a number/letter combination, that data comes bundled with the tidyr package. We loaded tidyr when we loaded the tidyverse. 

I'm making explicit in this call with the :: that table1 is a call from the tidyr package. Sometimes when writing code, it is useful to be explict about where methods come from, and this is how we do it in R. 

For the purpose of this workshop, we will draw on data packages, bundled data, or data frames that we manually create. However, it's useful to know how to read in data on your own. We won't cover these packages in this workshop, but it's worth knowing that the tidyverse installs a number of packages for reading data. 

- readr provides many functions for tabular data such as .csv files or tab files. 
- haven is the go to package for reading SPSS, stata, and SAS files. 
- DBI is a package that provides function for linking to databases, such as a SQLite database. 
- jsonlite is the go to package for reading json data, which is often useful when working with data on the internet. 
- httr provides a common framework for connecting to web APIs 
- rvest is a great package for parsing .html files. 

## Reshape Data 

The tidyverse is a great package because it is mature, which means that it is well-tested and has a consistent way of coding solutions. It's also great because the tidyverse is in active development, so if developers come up with a better way of doing something, then they will change to make it so. When this is done, it can change the best way to do something. Throughout this workshop, we might mention an "old" way so that if you are looking at someone's code or reading an older blogpost/stack overflow post, you can understand the point of that code. Nonetheless, it is our strong recommendation to use the latest functions. 

Here in this example, the old way of doing this action would be by using a function called gather(). The new function has different syntax, but does the same procedure. 

`pivot_longer()` makes datasets longer by increasing the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns. 

`pivot_longer()` also by default transforms non-informative columns into characters, so this is something to look out for when using pivot

`parse_integer()`and `parse_double()`: input string must be a single number with no leading or trailing characters. (`parse_number()` is more flexible: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr/vignettes/readr.html)

`pivot_wider()` increases the number of columns and decreases the number of rows, which makes the data wider. It is the inverse of `pivot_longer()`. 

##Notes for Challenge 3: 

From R for Data Science(https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html): "An explicit missing value is the presence of an absence; an implicit missing value is the absence of a presence." 


#Notes for Challenge 4: 

The values_fill() function takes a (scalar) value that specifies what each value should be filled in with when missing.This can be a named list if you want to apply different aggregations to different value columns.

## Separate 

We often have datasets that stuff multiple values into a singular cell. That's a violation of tidy data, and also often makes our analysis harder. Consider this toy example. Note that Dad, Mom, and Daughter are different types of people, not types of fruit. 

The `separate()` function pulls apart one column into multiple columns, by splitting wherever a separator character appears. 

##Practice Section 

For example, when you provide a separator character such as "/", the `seperate()` function will split the column into what comes before the forwardslash and what comes after it. 

The `convert=TRUE` subcommand in the `seperate()` function will automatically convert variables and is useful if the values are integer, numeric or logical.

## Unite 

Like `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`, `unite()` functions as the inverse of `separate()`. It tends to be useful when data that you want as a singular variable comes in multiple variables. As an example, sometimes a dataset will split a name up into first and last name. We might prefer to just have a single variable for name. This toy dataset provides an example. 



# Represent Data 

The last two major function we are going to cover surround representing our data. The `arrange()` function will place the values of the variable within the parentheses in ascending order while the `arrange(desc())` will place the values of the variable within the parentheses in descending order. 

## Arrange 

Datasets often come in ways that are difficult to extract information at a glance. For example, the built in dataset mtcars has data on a variety of different cars. If we were deciding to buy a car, we might be interested in looking at cars by miles per gallon. `arrange()`, which comes from the dplyr package, provides a way to order rows by a column. 

##Rename

In R, it's quite simple to rename a variable all you have to do in the tidyverse package is to called the dataframe, use the magrittr pipe, and specify the new name of the variable followed by an equal sign with the name of the old variable.
