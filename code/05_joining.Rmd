This workshop is for students who already have some experience with `tidyr` and `dplyr` and `tidyr` and hope to upgrade their data wrangling skills in R.

# Setup

- `pacman` is a great package management tool in R (for more information, see [the package vignette](http://trinker.github.io/pacman/vignettes/Introduction_to_pacman.html)).

- Check your `dplyr` package is up-to-date by typing `packageVersion("dplyr")`. If the current installed version is less than 1.0, then update by typing `update.packages("dplyr")`. You may need to restart R to make it work.

```{r}

ifelse(packageVersion("dplyr") > 1, "The installed version of dplyr package is greater than or equal to 1.0.0", update.packages("dplyr"))

```

```{r}

# p_load loads and, if necessary, install missing packages. 
# install.packages() + library() = p_load()
# If you just want to install, then use p_install()

if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse, # for the tidyverse framework
  nycflights13 # for exercise 
  )

```

Relational data = multiple tables of data

![Relational data example](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/245292d1ea724f6c3fd8a92063dcd7bfb9758d02/5751b/diagrams/relational-nycflights.png)

**Key ideas**

- A **primary key** "uniquely identifies an observation in its own table"

```{r}

# Example
planes$tailnum %>% head()

```

Verify primary key

`tailnum` should be unique. Thus, the result should be 0. 

```{r}
planes %>%
  count(tailnum) %>%
  filter(n > 1)
```

If a dataframe doesn't have primary key, you can add one called a **surrogate** key.

```{r}

# Toy example
df <- tibble(x = c(1:3),
             y = c(4:6))

# Add a row_index column 
df <- df %>% rowid_to_column("ID")

```
- A **foreign** key "uniquely identifies an observation in another table."

```{r}
flights$tailnum %>% head()
```

# Mutating joins

> Add new variables to one data frame from matching observations in another"

Using a simple toy example is great because it is easy to see how things work in that much narrow context. 

- Toy example 

```{r}

# Table 1 
x <- tibble(key = c(1:4),
            val_x = c("x1", "x2", "x3", "x4"))

# Table 2
y <- tibble(key = c(1:5),
            val_y = c("y1", "y2", "y3", "y4", "y5"))

```

## Inner Join

`inner_join()` keeps the matched values in both tables. If the left table is a subset of the right table, then the result of `left_join()` is same as `inner_join()`.

```{r}

inner_join(x, y)

```

![Mutating joins](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/aeab386461820b029b7e7606ccff1286f623bae1/ef0d4/diagrams/join-venn.png)

## Left Join

`left_join()`, `right_join()` and `full_join()` are outer join functions. Unlike `inner_join()`, outer join functions keep observations that appear in at least one of the tables.

`left_join()` keeps only the matched observations in the right table.

```{r}

left_join(x, y)

```

## Right Join

`right_join()` does the opposite.

```{r}

right_join(x, y)

```

## Full Join

`full_join()` keeps the observations from both tables. If they were unmatched, then NAs were recoded in one of the two tables.

```{r}

full_join(x, y)

```

# Filtering joins 

> Filter observations from one data frame based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table.

## Semi Join

- Filtering without joining 

```{r}

# Create the list of the top 10 destinations 
top_dest <- flights %>%
  count(dest, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(10)

# Filter
filtered <- flights %>%
  filter(dest %in% top_dest$dest)

```

- Using semi join: only keep (INCLUDE) the rows that were matched between the two tables 

```{r}

joined <- flights %>%
  semi_join(top_dest)

```

## Anti Join

`anti_join()` dose the opposite. Exclude the rows that were matched between the two tables. 

```{r}

flights %>%
  anti_join(planes, by = "tailnum") %>%
  count(tailnum, sort = TRUE)

```

# Set operations 

> Treat observations as if they were set elements. 

Another toy example. 

```{r}

df1 <- tibble(x = c(1, 2),
              y = c(1, 1))
  
df2 <- tibble(x = c(1, 1),
              y = c(1, 2))

df1

df2

```

## Intersect 

Return matched observations in the two tables

```{r}

intersect(df1, df2)

```

## Union

Return unique observations in the two tables 

```{r}

union(df1, df2)

```

## Set Diff 

Return observations in the left but not in the right table 

```{r}

setdiff(df1, df2)

```

# Binding 

## Bind Rows 

```{r}

bind_rows(df1, df2)

```

## Bind Columns 

```{r}

bind_cols(df1, df2)

```
