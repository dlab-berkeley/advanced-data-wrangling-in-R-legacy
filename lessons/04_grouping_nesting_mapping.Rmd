# Grouping 

## Grouped summaries 

- Calculate the mean of `gdpPercap`.

```{r}

gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>% # 
  summarise(mean_gdp = mean(gdpPercap))

```

- Calculate multiple summary statistics.

```{r}

gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>% # 
  summarise(mean_gdp = mean(gdpPercap),
            count = n())

```

**Optional**

- Other summary statistics

1. Measures of spread: `median(x)`, `sd(x)`, `IQR(x)`, `mad(x)` (the median absolute deviation)

```{r}

# The Interquartile Range = The Difference Between 75t and 25t Percentiles 

gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>% # 
  summarise(IQR_gdp = IQR(gdpPercap))

```

2. Measures of rank: `min(x)`, `quantile(x, 0.25)`, `max(x)`

```{r}

gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>% # 
  summarise(min_gdp = min(gdpPercap),
            max_gdp = max(gdpPercap))

```

3. Measures of position: `first(x)`, `last(x)`, `nth(x, 2)`

```{r}

gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarise(first_gdp = first(gdpPercap),
            last_gdp = last(gdpPercap))

gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  arrange(gdpPercap) %>% # Adding arrange
  summarise(first_gdp = first(gdpPercap),
            last_gdp = last(gdpPercap))

```

4. Measures of counts: `n(x)` (all rows), `sum(!is.na(x))` (only non-missing rows) = `n_distinct(x)`

```{r}

gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(ns = n())

```

5. Counts and proportions of logical values: `sum(condition about x)` (the number of TRUEs in x), `mean(condition about x)` (the proportion of TRUEs in x)

```{r}

gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarise(rich_countries = mean(gdpPercap > 20000))

```

# Nesting

## Nest

The following example comes from [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/many-models.html) by by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.

- How can you run multiple models simultaneously? Using a nested data frame. 

- **Grouped data: each row = an observation**

- **Nested data: each row = a group**

**Challenge 1**

In the following example, why did we use `country` and `continent` for nesting variables? 

```{r}

nested <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(country, continent) %>%
  nest() 

head(nested)

nested$data[[1]]

```

- Custom function 

```{r}

lm_model <- function(df) {
  
  lm(lifeExp ~ year, data = df)
}

```

- Apply function to the nested data 

```{r}

# Apply m_model to the nested data 

nested <- nested %>%
  mutate(models = map(data, lm_model)) # Add the list object as a new column

head(nested)

```
S3 is part of R's object oriented systems. If you need more information, check [this section](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/S3.html) in Hadley's Advanced R out.

## Unnest 

`glance()` function from `broom` package inspects the quality of a statistical model.

**Additional tips**

- `broom::glance(model)`: for evaluating model quality and/or complexity 
- `broom::tidy(model)`: for extracting each coefficient in the model (the estimates + its variability)
- `broom::augment(model, data)`: for getting extra values (residuals, and influence statistics)


```{r}

glanced <- nested %>%
  mutate(glance = map(models, broom::glance))

glanced$glance[[1]]

```

`unnest()` unpacks the list objects stored in glance column 

```{r}

glanced %>% 
  unnest(glance) %>%
  arrange(BIC) # Low to High; Lower BIC indicates a better model fit 

glanced %>% 
  unnest(glance) %>%
  ggplot(aes(continent, BIC)) +
    geom_jitter(width = 0.5)

```

# Mapping 

We tasted a little bit about how `map()` function works. Let's dig into it deeper as this family of functions is really useful. For more information, see Rebecca Barter's wonderful tutorial on the `purrr` package. In her words, this is "the tidyverse's answer to apply functions for iteration". `map()` function can take a vector (of any type), a list, and a dataframe for input. 

```{r}

multiply <- function(x){
  x*x 
}

df <- list(first_obs = rnorm(7, 1, sd =1),
           second_obs = rnorm(7, 2, sd = 2)) # normal distribution 

```

**Challenge 2**

Try `map_df(.x = df, .f = multiply)` and tell me what's the difference between the output you got and what you saw earlier.
