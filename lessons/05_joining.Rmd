# Relational data = multiple tables of data

![Relational data example](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/245292d1ea724f6c3fd8a92063dcd7bfb9758d02/5751b/diagrams/relational-nycflights.png)

**Key ideas**

- A **primary key** "uniquely identifies an observation in its own table"

```{r}

# Example
planes$tailnum %>% head()

```

Verify primary key

`tailnum` should be unique. 

**Challenge 1**
What do you expect the outcome?

```{r}
planes %>%
  count(tailnum) %>%
  filter(n > 1)
```
**Optional**
If a dataframe doesn't have primary key, you can add one called a **surrogate** key.

```{r}

# Toy example
df <- tibble(x = c(1:3),
             y = c(4:6))

# Add a row_index column 
df <- df %>% rowid_to_column("ID")

```

- A **foreign** key "uniquely identifies an observation in another table."

```{r}

flights$tailnum %>% head()

```

# Mutating joins

> Add new variables to one data frame from matching observations in another"

Using a simple toy example is great because it is easy to see how things work in that much narrow context. 

- Toy example 

```{r}

# Table 1 
x <- tibble(key = c(1:4),
            val_x = c("x1", "x2", "x3", "x4"))

# Table 2
y <- tibble(key = c(1:5),
            val_y = c("y1", "y2", "y3", "y4", "y5"))

```

## Inner Join

`inner_join()` keeps the matched values in both tables. If the left table is a subset of the right table, then the result of `left_join()` is same as `inner_join()`.

**Challenge 2**

What are going to be the shared keys?

```{r}

inner_join(x, y)

```

## Left Join

`left_join()`, `right_join()` and `full_join()` are outer join functions. Unlike `inner_join()`, outer join functions keep observations that appear in at least one of the tables.

`left_join()` keeps only the matched observations in the right table.

```{r}

left_join(x, y)

```

## Right Join

`right_join()` does the opposite.

```{r}

right_join(x, y)

```

## Full Join

`full_join()` keeps the observations from both tables. If they were unmatched, then NAs were recoded in one of the two tables.

```{r}

full_join(x, y)

```

# Filtering joins 

> Filter observations from one data frame based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table.

## Semi Join

In SQL, this type of query is also called subqueries. 

- Filtering without joining 

```{r}

# Create the list of the top 10 destinations 
top_dest <- flights %>%
  count(dest, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(10)

# Filter
filtered <- flights %>%
  filter(dest %in% top_dest$dest)

```

- Using semi join: only keep (INCLUDE) the rows that were matched between the two tables 

```{r}

joined <- flights %>%
  semi_join(top_dest)

head(filtered == joined)

```

## Anti Join

`anti_join()` dose the opposite. Exclude the rows that were matched between the two tables. Great technique to filter stopwords when you do a computational text analysis.

```{r}

flights %>%
  anti_join(planes, by = "tailnum") %>%
  count(tailnum, sort = TRUE)

```
