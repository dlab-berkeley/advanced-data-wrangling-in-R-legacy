This workshop is for students who already have some experience with tidy workflows in R, who are familiar with tidyverse packages like dplyr and tidyr and hope to upgrade their data wrangling skills.

# Setup

-   `pacman` is a great package management tool in R (for more information, see [the package vignette](http://trinker.github.io/pacman/vignettes/Introduction_to_pacman.html)).

-   Check your `dplyr` package is up-to-date by typing `packageVersion("dplyr")`. If the current installed version is less than 1.0, then update by typing `update.packages("dplyr")`. You may need to restart R to make it work.

```{r}

ifelse(packageVersion("dplyr") > 1, "The installed version of dplyr package is greater than or equal to 1.0.0", update.packages("dplyr"))
  
```

```{r}

# p_load loads and, if necessary, install missing packages.
# install.packages() + library() = p_load()
# If you just want to install, then use p_install()

if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse, # for the tidyverse framework
  palmerpenguins,
  gapminder, 
  kableExtra, 
  flextable,
  modelr,
  nycflights13 
  )

```

The rest of the workshop follows the basic structure in [the Data Wrangling Cheat Sheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf) created by RStudio.

# Tidy Data

Many of the following examples draw on [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.

> "Tidy data sets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table." - Hadley Wickham

1.  Variables -\> **Columns**
2.  Observations -\> **Rows**
3.  Values -\> **Cells**

![Tidy Data Example (Source: R for Data Science)](https://garrettgman.github.io/images/tidy-1.png)

A tidy data can be stored in a `data.frame` or [`tibble`](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) object.

**Benefits**

> "If your data is tidy, element-wise execution will ensure that observations are preserved across functions and operations. Each value will only be paired with other values that appear in the same row of the data frame." - Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham

-   Nevertheless, don't be too strict.

> In summary, tidy data is a useful conceptual idea and is often the right way to go for general, small data sets, but may not be appropriate for all problems. - Jeff Leek

For instance, in many data science applications, linear algebra-based computations (e.g., [Principal Component Analysis](https://www.math.upenn.edu/~kazdan/312S13/JJ/PCA-JJ.pdf)) are optimized to work on matrices, not tidy data frames (for more information, read [Jeff Leek's blog post](https://simplystatistics.org/2016/02/17/non-tidy-data/)).

This is what a tidy data looks like. 

```{r}
# This dataset is bundled with the tidyr package. 
#When we load the tidyverse, we load lots of packages 
#including tidyr
tidyr::table1

```

**Additional tips**

Packages for importing data:

1.  Basic: `readr`
2.  SPSS, Stata, and SAS files: `haven`
3.  Database: `DBI`
4.  json: `jsonlite`
5.  Web APIs: `httr`
6.  HTML: `rvest`

# Reshape Data

Let's take a look at the cases of untidy data.

![Messy Data Case 1 (Source: R for Data Science)](https://garrettgman.github.io/images/tidy-5.png)

## Make It Longer

**Challenge 1**: Why this data is not tidy?

```{r}

table4a

```

-   Let's pivot (rotate by 90 degree).

-   [`pivot_longer()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_longer.html) increases the number of rows (longer) and decreases the number of columns. The inverse function is `pivot_wider()`. These functions improve the usability of `gather()` and `spread()`.

![What pivot\_longer() does (Source: <https://www.storybench.org>)](https://www.storybench.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pivot-longer-image.png)

```{r}
# New way, more intuitive
table4a %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("1999", "2000"), # Select columns
    names_to = "year", # Shorter columns (the columns going to be in one column called year)
    values_to = "cases") # Longer rows (the values are going to be in a separate column called named cases)

```

-   There's another problem, did you catch it?

-   The data type of `year` variable should be `numeric` not `character`. By default, `pivot_longer()` transforms uninformative columns to character.

-   You can fix this problem by using `names_transform` argument.

```{r}

table4a %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("1999", "2000"), # Put two columns together
    names_to = "year", # Shorter columns (the columns going to be in one column called year)
    values_to = "cases", # Longer rows (the values are going to be in a separate column called named cases)
    names_transform = list(year = readr::parse_integer)
    ) # Transform the variable  

```

**Additional tips**

`parse_number()` also keeps only numeric information in a variable.

```{r}

parse_number("reply1994")

```

A flat file (e.g., CSV) is a rectangular shaped combination of strings. [Parsing](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr/vignettes/readr.html) determines the type of each column and turns into a vector of a more specific type. Tidyverse has `parse_` functions (from `readr` package) that are flexible and fast (e.g., `parse_integer()`, `parse_double()`, `parse_logical()`, `parse_datetime()`, `parse_date()`, `parse_time()`, `parse_factor()`, etc).

-   Let's do another practice.

**Challenge 2**

1.  Why this data is not tidy? (This exercise comes from [`pivot` function vigenette](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html).) Too long or too wide?

```{r}
## billboard is a dataset bundled with the tidyr package 
billboard

```

2.  How can you fix it? Which pivot?

```{r}
billboard %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("wk"), # Use regular expressions
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "rank",
    values_drop_na = TRUE # Drop NAs
  )

```

## Make It Wider

-   Why this data is not tidy?

```{r}

table2

```

-   Each observation is spread across two rows.

-   How can you fix it?: `pivot_wider()`.

**Two differences between `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`**

-   In `pivot_longer()`, the arguments are named `names_to` and `values_to` (*to*).

-   In `pivot_wider()`, this pattern is opposite. The arguments are named `names_from` and `values_from` (*from*).

-   The number of required arguments for `pivot_longer()` is 3 (col, names\_to, values\_to).

-   The number of required arguments for `pivot_wider()` is 2 (names\_from, values\_from).

![What pivot\_wider() does (Source: <https://www.storybench.org>)](https://www.storybench.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pivot-wider-image.png)

```{r}
table2 %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = type, # first
    values_from = count # second
  )

```

People often ask: "I don't any missing values in my original dataframe, but R says I have missing values after I've done some data transformations. What's happening?"

Here's an answer.

R defines missing values in two ways.

- Implicit missing values: simply not present in the data.

- Explicit missing values: flagged with NA

**Challenge 3**

The example comes from [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html).

```{r}

stocks <- tibble(
  year = c(2019, 2019, 2019, 2020, 2020, 2020),
  qtr = c(1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4), 
  return = c(1, 2, 3, NA, 2, 3)
)

```

-   Where are the explicit missing values?

-   Does `stocks` have implicit missing values?

```{r}

# implicit missing values become explicit 
stocks %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, 
              values_from = return)

```

**Challenge 4**

-   This exercise comes from [`pivot` function vigenette](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html).

-   Could you make `station` a series of dummy variables using `pivot_wider()`?

```{r}

fish_encounters

```

1.  Which pivot you should use?

```{r}

fish_encounters %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = station, 
    values_from = seen, 
    values_fill = list(seen = 0)
  )

```

2.  Are there explicit missing values?

3.  How could you turn these NAs into 0s? Check `values_fill` argument in the `pivot_wider()` function.

## Separate

![Messy Data Case 2 (Source: R for Data Science)](https://garrettgman.github.io/images/tidy-6.png)

```{r}

# Toy example
df <- tibble(
  x = c(NA, "Dad.apple", "Mom.orange", "Daughter.banana"))

```

```{r}

# Separate
df %>%
  separate(x, 
           into = c("Name", "Preferred_fruit"))

```

```{r}
# Don't need the first variable

df %>%
  separate(x, into = c(NA, "Preferred_fruit"))
```

**Practice**

```{r}

table3

```

-   Note `sep` argument. You can specify how to separate joined values.

```{r}
table3 %>%
  separate(rate, # define the column 
           into = c("cases", "population"),
           sep = "/")

```

-   Note `convert` argument. You can specify whether automatically convert the new values or not.

```{r}

table3 %>%
  separate(rate,
           into = c("cases", "population"),
           sep = "/",
           convert = TRUE) # cases and population become integers

```

## Unite

`pivot_longer()` \<-\> `pivot_wider()`

`separate()` \<-\> `unite()`

```{r}
# Create a toy example
df <- tibble(
  first_name = c("Jae", "Sun", "Jane", NA),
  last_name = c("April", "April", "June", NA))

```


```{r}
# Include missing values
df %>% unite(col = "full_name",
             c("first_name", "last_name"), # unite these two columns 
             sep = " ") # add a space 
```


```{r}
# Do not include missing values
df %>% unite(col = "full_name",
             c("first_name", "last_name"), # unite these two columns 
             sep = " ",
             na.rm = TRUE)
```

# Represent Data

## Arrange

-   Order rows

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  arrange(mpg) # Low to High (default)

mtcars %>% 
  arrange(desc(mpg)) # High to Row

```

## Rename

-   Rename columns

```{r}

df <- tibble(y = c(2011, 2012, 2013))

df %>% 
  rename(Year = # NEW name
                y) # OLD name

```
